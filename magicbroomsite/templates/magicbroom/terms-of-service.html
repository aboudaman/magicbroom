    <p><h5>Time Constraints: </h5><br />
    We will make every effort possible to meet any time constraint you may have.  This includes attempting to bring on a second or even third maid to complete the service.  However, the Magic Broom staff will not be responsible for unfinished cleanings when the customer puts the team on an unrealistic deadline.  Magic Broom will always clean until the service is completed but cannot be held responsible for cleanings not being finished due to the customer not booking enough time.  Please feel free to give us a call (407)286-8421 before booking to avoid any confusion.  If your time is limited we can work with you over the phone to pick out a time that works with all parties.</p>

    Please give Magic Broom a call at (407)286-8421 or email us at info@magicbroom.us if you wish to change the time or date of your service.  Please DO NOT attempt to change the time and date directly with the cleaning professional, it could result in a schedule clash due to the maid's prebooked schedule.
